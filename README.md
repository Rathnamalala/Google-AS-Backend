# Backend - App Popularity Predictor

This is the **Backend** for the **App Popularity Predictor** project. The backend is built using **Python** and **Flask**, providing a RESTful API to predict app popularity based on various input features. It handles POST requests from the frontend, performs predictions, and returns results.

## Features:
- Provides an API endpoint to predict app popularity.
- Uses machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression or any suitable model) for prediction.
- Simple RESTful API structure.
- Can be easily extended with new machine learning models or features.

## Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Flask
- scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Flask-CORS (to handle cross-origin requests)
